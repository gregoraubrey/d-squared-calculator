# D-Squared Calculator

This repository contains a Java program that calculates the distribution of "d-squared" values for all permutations of integers `1` through `n` (where `n` is a positive integer) and writes the results to a `.txt` file. The main idea is to understand the distribution of values generated by taking the difference between original and permuted sequences and squaring them. The values from the text file could then be plotted on a line graph to observe the distribution.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- `DSquaredCalculator.java`: The principal class that contains the logic for calculating the distribution of d-squared values for all permutations of numbers from `1` to `n`. It also writes the results to an output file.
- `Main.java`: The entry point for the program. It prompts the user for input, creates an instance of `DSquaredCalculator`, and triggers the calculation and file output.

## How It Works

1. **User Input**: The program asks the user for a positive integer value (`n`). The program will keep asking ad infinitum until a valid input is given.
2. **Permutation Generation**: An instance of the `DSquaredCalculator` class generates all possible permutations of numbers from `1` to `n`, e.g. for `n = 3` it would generate `[1,2,3]`, `[1,3,2]`, `[2,1,3]`, `[2,3,1]`, `[3,1,2]`, and `[3,2,1]`.
3. **D-Squared Calculation**: For each permutation, the program calculates a so-called "d-squared" value by summing the squares of the differences between each element in the original sequence and its corresponding element in the permutation.

Example:
- Consider `n = 3`, where the original sequence is `[1,2,3]`.
- Take a permutation, such as `[3,1,2]`.
- To calcluate the d-squared value, we compare each element of the permutation against the corresponding element in the original sequence:
    - Difference at position 1: `1 - 3 = -2`, then squared gives `(-2)^2 = 4`
    - Difference at position 2: `2 - 1 = 1`, then squared gives `1^2 = 1`
    - Difference at position 3: `3 - 2 = 1`, then squared gives `1^2 = 1`
- Sum all those squared differences: `4 + 1 + 1 = 6`
- So the d-squared value for the permutation `[3,1,2]` is 6.
- N.B. It does not matter whether you do `permutation - original` or the other way round for each element because we square the result, leading to the same answer (e.g. `(1 - 3)^2 = (3 - 1)^2`).

4. **Results File**: The results are written to a text file named `d-squared-from-1-to-n.txt` (where `n` is the value provided by the user). The file contains a breakdown of the number of times each d-squared value appears among all permutations.

Example:
- The file named `d-squared-from-1-to-3.txt`:
```txt
0,1
2,2
4,0
6,2
8,1

```
- The left shows d-squared value, and the right shows how many permutations had that d-squared value
    - e.g. `0,1` makes sense because only the original permutation will give a d-squared value of 0, hence d-squared of `0` being produced by `1` permutation.

## Running the Program

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    Start by cloning the repository to your local machine using `git clone <REPO-URL>`.

2. **Compile the Code**:
   Then, compile all Java files in the `src` directory. You can use the following command from the root directory of the repository:
   ```bash
   javac src/*.java
   ```

3. **Run the Program**:
   After compiling, you can run the `Main` class using:
   ```bash
   java -cp src Main
   ```

4. **User Interaction**:
   The program will then prompt you to enter a positive integer value for `n`. Once provided, the program will generate all permutations, calculate d-squared values, and write the results to a text file in the current directory. It will then print a line informing you that the file has been saved, and it will give you the full path to said file.

## Requirements

- You need to have the JDK installed on your machine to compile and run the program.
